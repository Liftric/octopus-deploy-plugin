The octopus-deploy-plugin generates build-information and uploads packages and generated build-information to Octopus Deploy instances.

Requirements:
 * [Octopus Deploy CLI](https://octopus.com/downloads/octopuscli)
 * git (for commit/changelog calculation)
 
# Usage
The plugin can be configured with the `octopus` DSL block:
```
plugins {
    id("com.liftric.octopus-deploy-plugin") version "whatever"
}
[...]
octopus {
    serverUrl = "http://localhost:8080/"
    apiKey = "API-TESTTEST123TRESDTSDD"

    generateChangelogSinceLastTag = true

    val jar by tasks.existing(Jar::class)
    packageName = jar.get().archiveBaseName.get()
    version = jar.get().archiveVersion.get()
    pushPackage = jar.get().archiveFile.get().asFile
}
```

See the example directory for a minimal, working example.

## tasks
The following tasks are added by the plugin:

Task | Description
---|---
previousTag | Calls git describe to receive the previous tag name. Will fail if no tag is found.
firstCommitHash | Calls git log to get the first commit hash of the current history tree
commitsSinceLastTag | Calls git log to receive all commits since the previous tag or the first commit of the current history.
createBuildInformation | Creates the octopus build-information file.
uploadBuildInformation | Uploads the created octopus build-information file.
uploadPackage | Uploads the package to octopus.

For normale use-cases, only `uploadBuildInformation` are `uploadPackage` are needed to call explicitly. Depending
task will be called implicitly by both as needed.

**Noteworthy**: The build-information can be uploaded before the package itself. 
Useful when creating automatic releases and using the commits in the release notes in octopus.

## naming
Octopus deploy expects the name and version in the following format: `<name>.<version>.<extension>`

For Java archives, `<name>-<version>.<extension>` is conventional, so should be changed to get picked up properly by octopus.
Otherwise the first version number part will be parsed as part of the name.

## configuration
After the plugin is applied, the vault extension is registered with the following settings:

Property | Description | default value 
---|---|---
apiKey | Octopus deploy server API key | -
serverUrl | Octopus deploy server URL | -
generateChangelogSinceLastTag | Enable to calculate the commits for the changelog when uploading build-information (needs git installed) | false
commitLinkBaseUrl | Prefix / Baseurl for the build-information commit urls | http://git.example.com/repo/commits/
outputDir | Output folder for files generated by the plugin | build/octopus
gitRoot | Directory to run the git helpers in. By default the projects root dir | project.rootDir
pushPackage | Target file (package) which will be uploaded to octopus | 
version | Package version | -
packageName | Package name | -
buildInformationOverwriteMode | octo build-information OverwriteMode | -
pushOverwriteMode | octo push OverwriteMode | -
buildInformationAddition | Customize the final octopus build-information before uploading | {}
gitlab() | Default `buildInformationAddition` implementation adding context from the CI environment for Gitlab CI. Also sets `commitLinkBaseUrl`. | not applied

`generateChangelogSinceLastTag` extracts all commits between the HEAD and the last tag. 
If no tag is found, the first commit in the history tree is used instead.
